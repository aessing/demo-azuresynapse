#  Azure Synapse Analytics Demos
This repository includes all code of my Azure Synapse Analytics demo environment. I use the source control capabilities of Synapse Analytics to keep this repositoy in sync with my work, like described in this [Synapse Analytics documentation article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/cicd/source-control).

## Experience a new class of analytics
Azure Synapse Analytics is a limitless analytics service that brings together data integration, enterprise data warehousing, and big data analytics. It gives you the freedom to query data on your terms, using either serverless or dedicated resources—at scale. Azure Synapse brings these worlds together with a unified experience to ingest, explore, prepare, manage, and serve data for immediate BI and machine learning needs.

## Polaris Distributed Query Engine
In the [linked paper](https://aka.ms/synapse-dqp), Microsoft describes the Polaris distributed SQL query engine in Azure Synapse. It is the result of a multi-year project to rearchitect the query processing framework in the SQL DW parallel data warehouse service, and addresses two main goals:

- converge data warehousing and big data workloads, and 
- separate compute and state for cloud-native execution.
