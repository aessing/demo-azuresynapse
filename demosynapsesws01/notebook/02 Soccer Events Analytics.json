					"Now that the data shape and format is all set, it’s time to dig in and try and find answers to a few business questions. We’ll use plain-old super-strong SQL (Spark SQL) for that purpose, and create a second notebook from the perspective of data analysts.\r\n",
					"\r\n",
					"In this notebook, we'll analyze the transformed soccer game events to answer questions like:\r\n",
					"\r\n",
					"* What's the distribution of goals by shot place (place within the goal area)?\r\n",
					"* What's the distribution of goals by different soccer leagues?\r\n",
					"* What are the top locations (on-field player position) for each shot place in Spanish league?\r\n",
					"* When/What time window are most goals scored within a game in each league?\r\n",
					"\r\n",
					"We'll also take a look at how to use third-party libraries for visualizations - like creating a 3D scatter-plot to see distribution of goals by shot place and location."
